# Jumpy-Mac-Jumpface
Small Project for JIN

The main aspect of this project is to create a Platformer without using the physics integrated in Unity.
The physic Works With Raycasts and some triggers. 
We implemented multiple gameplay features:
  - Double Jump
  - Tether (Smash forever)
  - Wall Jump

The aim was to keep the visual part as simple as possible to judge the gameplay over the art.
Hope you enjoy ;)
